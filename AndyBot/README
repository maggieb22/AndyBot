README <AndyBot>

HANDIN: Final

DESIGN CHOICES: I chose to add all of the movements of andybot under the solve method.
After I got andybot to move to the final location i nested the get hint code inside of the solve road block
so that way when it solved the road block and entered the password it already had the hint. After it solved The
password I had andybot take two steps forward to exit the maze. I made sure that when i called the solveRoadBlock
and the enterPassword that i used "this" cause andybot was the one doing it. That's basically it for my design choices.

KNOWN BUGS: No known bugs :)
